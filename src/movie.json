Sergeant Kyu-nam, who has been planning an escape to the South for a long time, gets caught while stopping a common soldier, Dong-hyuk, from escaping. At risk of execution, State Security Department Major Hyun-sang recognizes Kyu-nam from childhood. Instead of accusing him, Hyun-sang decides to make Kyu-nam a hero, who caught a deserter. Hyun-sang, therefore, has succeeded in securing his performance records by saving Kyu-nam’s life. Nevertheless, Kyu-nam wants to live his life by his own will, not the government’s commands. He never gives up on crossing the border. On the other hand, Hyun-sang desperately stops Kyu-nam to protect his life which has been built by giving up his dream.",
